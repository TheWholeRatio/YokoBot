# YokoBot
Discord Bot for friends. Included pokemon game I suppose.
Make sure to replace the token in index.js with your own token from your server.



#Runescape
ex: type "yoko price iron bar'
and yoko bot will report the current price the iron bar.
this works with all items in the GE market.


#Pokemon
ex: type "yoko pokemon" to start the game
